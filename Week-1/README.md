📘 Week 1 – Python Basics Internship Task<br>

Personal Introduction Program<br>
📖 Introduction<br>
This repository documents my Week 1 internship task, where I learned the fundamentals of Python programming through a structured, day-by-day approach.<br>
The focus of this week was to understand how Python works, how programs take user input, and how meaningful output can be displayed.<br>

By the end of Week 1, I successfully built a Personal Introduction Program that interacts with the user and displays a friendly welcome message using basic Python concepts.<br>

🎯 Objectives of Week 1<br>
Understand what programming is<br>
Learn Python syntax and structure<br>
Write and execute simple Python programs<br>
Take user input using Python<br>
Store data using variables<br>
Display formatted output<br>
Improve code readability<br>
Practice testing and debugging<br>

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used<br>
Python 3<br>
Google Colab <br>
Python .py file<br>
GitHub for version control and submission<br>


🗓️ Day-Wise Work Description<br>
✅ Day 1: Hello World Program<br>
🔹 What I Did<br>
On the first day, I wrote my very first Python program that prints a simple message on the screen.<br>

🔹 Purpose<br>
To understand how Python programs are written and executed<br>
To get familiar with Python syntax<br>

🔹 Activities Performed<br>
Used the print() function<br>
Executed the program successfully<br>

🔹 What I Learned<br>
Python executes code line by line<br>
print() is used to display output<br>
Even a single-line program can perform an action<br>

✅ Day 2: User Input and Variables<br>
🔹 What I Did<br>
On Day 2, I learned how to take input from the user and store it in variables.<br>
🔹 Purpose<br>
To make the program interactive<br>
To understand how user data is handled in Python<br>

🔹 Activities Performed<br>
Used the input() function<br>
Stored user input in variables<br>
Printed the stored values<br>

🔹 What I Learned<br>
How input() works<br>
How variables store user-provided data<br>
Difference between input and output<br>

✅ Day 3: Personalized Welcome Message<br>
🔹 What I Did<br>
I enhanced the program by displaying a personalized welcome message using user input.<br>

🔹 Purpose<br>
To combine text and variables<br>
To create meaningful output<br>

🔹 Activities Performed<br>
Used f-strings<br>
Displayed customized messages<br>

🔹 What I Learned<br>
How f-strings simplify string formatting<br>
How to dynamically insert variable values into text<br>
Importance of user-friendly messages<br>

✅ Day 4: Enhanced Program<br>
🔹 What I Did<br>
On Day 4, I improved the program by adding more user questions and better output formatting.<br>

🔹 Purpose<br>
To make the program more detailed<br>
To improve readability of output<br>

🔹 Activities Performed<br>
Added inputs for city and hobby<br>
Used separators for better formatting<br>
Organized the output neatly<br>

🔹 What I Learned<br>
Handling multiple user inputs<br>
Structuring output for clarity<br>
Improving user experience<br>

✅ Day 5: Finalize & Test<br>
🔹 What I Did<br>
On the final day, I reviewed the entire program and created the final version.<br>

🔹 Purpose><br>
To ensure the program works correctly<br>
To prepare it for submission<br>

🔹 Activities Performed<br>
Added comments to explain code<br>
Fixed minor formatting issues<br>
Tested the program with different inputs<br>
Finalized the Personal Introduction Program<br>

🔹 What I Learned<br>
Importance of code comments<br>
Importance of testing before submission<br>
Writing clean and readable code<br>
Finalizing a project professionally<br>

🧪 Testing & Validation<br>
The program was tested using:<br>
Different names<br>
Different ages<br>
Different cities<br>
Different hobbies<br>
Each test produced correct and expected output with no errors.<br>
User input interaction<br>
Final output of the program<br>

🧠 Overall Learning Outcome<br>

By completing Week 1, I gained:<br>
A strong foundation in Python basics<br>
Confidence in writing Python programs<br>
Understanding of program flow<br>
Experience with user interaction in Python<br>
Basic project organization using GitHub<br>

🚀 Conclusion<br>
Week 1 was an important learning phase in my internship journey.<br>
Starting from a simple Hello World program, I progressed step by step to create a complete interactive Python program.<br>

This week helped me build confidence and prepared me for more advanced Python concepts in upcoming weeks.<br>

✅ Status<br>
✔ Week 1 Task Completed Successfully<br>
